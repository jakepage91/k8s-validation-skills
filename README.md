# Kubernetes Validation Skills

A Claude Code plugin that validates Kubernetes manifests, application code, Dockerfiles, and Helm charts. The skill activates automatically when you generate Kubernetes-related code, applying NEVER/ALWAYS rules across two equal halves: **security** and **correctness**.

> The repo is named `k8s-security-skills` for historical reasons. The skill itself is `k8s-validation` and covers more than security alone.

## What it validates

### Security domains

- **Secrets management**: never hardcode secrets, always use Kubernetes Secrets or external secret managers.
- **Pod and container security**: SecurityContext hardening, resource limits, non-root execution.
- **Network exposure and Ingress**: authentication on endpoints, NetworkPolicies, TLS requirements.
- **Supply chain**: pinned dependencies, digest-pinned images, secure Dockerfiles.
- **Internal service auth**: service-to-service auth, mTLS, JWT validation.
- **File handling and path security**: path traversal prevention, input sanitization.
- **LLM and AI workload security**: OWASP LLM Top 10 compliance.
- **Helm and manifest generation**: secure templating, PodDisruptionBudgets, probes.
- **RBAC and ServiceAccounts**: least privilege, dedicated ServiceAccounts.
- **Observability and incident response**: secure logging, metrics, alerting.
- **App security**: app-layer auth, IDOR, injection.

### Correctness domains

- **HTTP and types**: parameter source matches HTTP method, type coercion at boundaries, environment-dependent code paths.
- **Data flow**: SQL aliases match downstream property access, WHERE clauses don't silently skip, request data reaches the query and the query result reaches the response.
- **API contracts**: response shapes match consumers, pagination math is correct, breaking changes are versioned.
- **Async and error handling**: missing `await` is flagged, error fallbacks don't swallow real failures.
- **Environment configuration**: env var names in code match Kubernetes Secret keys and Helm values, required config fails fast at startup.
- **Test coverage**: new endpoints ship with integration tests that exercise the actual risk, not just the happy path.

## Installation

### Claude Code plugin (recommended)

```
/plugin install k8s-validation@jakepage91/k8s-security-skills
```

The skill activates automatically when generating Kubernetes-related code. The audit command becomes available as `/k8s-validation:audit`.

### Cursor

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakepage91/k8s-security-skills.git .k8s-validation

cat >> .cursorrules << 'EOF'

## Validation Rules
Always read and follow the rules in .k8s-validation/skills/k8s-validation/SKILL.md
when generating or modifying Kubernetes manifests, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, or
application code that runs in Kubernetes.
EOF
```

### GitHub Copilot

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakepage91/k8s-security-skills.git .k8s-validation

mkdir -p .github
cat >> .github/copilot-instructions.md << 'EOF'

## Validation Rules
Always read and follow the rules in .k8s-validation/skills/k8s-validation/SKILL.md.
EOF
```

## What you get

Installing the plugin gives you two things at once:

1. **The skill** (`k8s-validation`): NEVER/ALWAYS rules that load into the AI's context automatically when generating Kubernetes-related code. You don't invoke the skill; it just shapes what gets generated.
2. **The audit command** (`/k8s-validation:audit`): an explicit, invokable check you can run on your codebase (or a specific path) to find rule violations in code that already exists.

These map to two distinct validation layers: shaping what gets generated vs. checking what was generated. Skills are passive; commands are active. You use both.

## Auditing existing code

Audit the whole repository or a specific app at any point:

```
/k8s-validation:audit                  # audit entire repo
/k8s-validation:audit llm-gateway/     # audit a specific app or directory
```

The audit command:

1. Discovers Kubernetes manifests, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, CI/CD pipeline files, and application code with HTTP endpoints, database queries, file operations, async patterns, or environment variable access.
2. Loads only the reference files relevant to what was found.
3. Reads application code files fully and traces data flow end-to-end.
4. Checks every file against applicable NEVER/ALWAYS rules from both security and correctness domains.
5. Classifies each finding by severity: **CRITICAL**, **HIGH**, **MEDIUM**, **INFO**.
6. Writes results to `SECURITY-POSTURE.md` in the project root with recommended fixes.

> The audit is read-only. It never modifies your code. Findings include concrete remediation snippets so you can apply fixes deliberately.
